# Length-of-Stay-of-Patients-with-Opioid-Overdose

## Introduction
In this work, multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented to process data and predict length of stay (LOS) among admitted patients with opioid overdose.

## Data

**The Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin** offers anonymous patient data. Patients were anonymized by removing their identifiers and Institutional Review Board approval was received. All dates and times were subjected to random offsets. Data include 9-year time span from March 2012 to June 2020.
